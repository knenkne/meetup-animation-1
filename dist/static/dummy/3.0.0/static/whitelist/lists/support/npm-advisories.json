It traverses DOM elements looking for fields such as `username` and `password` and uploads it to a remote server. The package also port-scans the local gateway and uploads the information to the remote server. It has a feature to fetch commands from the remote server and execute them with `eval`. The npm security team analysis found several bugs in the malware that prevent it from actually performing its actions. The malicious code is also not invoked upon installation or require; it would require transpiling TypeScript code and using it in a website.\n",

    "recommendation": "Update to version 0.12.7 or later.\n\nAs this vulnerability is primarily a user error, the patch for the vulnerability will simply cause the application to write an error message to the console when a vulnerable configuration is used in a production environment.\n\nWriting a proper CORS configuration is still the responsibility of the user, so it is necessary to check for the error message after installing the patch. Be sure you are not using `allRoutes: true` with `origin:'*'`, and that you uncomment `origin` and set it to a reasonable value. Ensure that if `origin` is set to `*` that you truly mean for all other websites to be able to make cross-domain requests to your API.\n\nLikewise, ensure `credentials` is uncommented out and set to the appropriate value. Make sure to explicitly set which origins may request resources via CORS.",

Node.js manages Buffers by creating a few large internal SlowBuffers, and slicing them up into smaller Buffers which are made accessible in JS.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to guess the password for the admin service, no matter how complex that password is, in less than 200 requests.\n\n\n## Details\nThe tomato API has an admin service that is enabled by setting up an `access_key` in the config options. This `access_key` is intended to protect the API admin from unauthorized access.\n\n\nTomato verifies the `access_key` by checking to see if the server `access_key` incorporates the user provided value at any location. This allows an attacker to provide a single character as an `access_key`, and so long as the server key contains at least one instance of that character it will be considered a valid key.\n\n## Proof of Concept\nThis is the snippet of code that does the comparison to authorize requests.\n\n```\nif (access_key && config.master.api.access_key.indexOf(access_key) !== -1) {\n```\n\nFor an access_key that is set to anything that includes the letter 'a' the following request would be authorized.\n\n```\n$ curl -X POST \"http://localhost:8081/api/exec\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d @test -H \"access-key: a\"\n{\n \"cmd\": \"ls\",\n \"path\": \".\",\n \"stdout\": \"app.js\\nconfig.js\\nlog\\nnode_modules\\nserver.js\\n\",\n \"stderr\": \"\"\n}\n```\n",
